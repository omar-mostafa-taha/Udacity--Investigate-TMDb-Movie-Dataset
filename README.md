# Udacity--Investigate-TMDb-Movie-Dataset
## Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset and communicate my findings about it. To achieve this, i  used Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which  made the analysis process easier.
This project provided me an opportunity to go through the entire data analysis process and see how everything fits together.

## By completing this project, i have learned the following:

* Understand all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
* Be able to ask relevant questions that can be answered with the given dataset and then answer them.
* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format that can be used.
* Practice communicating the results of your analysis effectively.
* Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code.
* Become familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which allow you to access your data more conveniently.
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots that show your findings.
